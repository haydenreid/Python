# Python
Projects done in Python for UT Dallas, mostly analytics related. 

The first project, project 1 is a dataset on inmates and their propensity to committ crime once they are released. In my analysis
I explore different approaches to predicting whether or not a convict is a 'recidivist' (will likely committ another crime) or not.

The second project is the estimation of a Kumaraswamy distribution's parameters, when all that was provided was the data. Comments include
my thought process on solving the problem, and the end results.
